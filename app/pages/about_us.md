# Ideathon title

Digest IM8 using GenAI

## Problem Statement

There's a lot of cross referencing and both technical and legalese language in IM, especially IM8. Can we leverage GPT's ability to rephrase and "remember" context to do topic search e.g. "encryption everywhere" and cross referencing?

## Proposed Solution

Flatten IM8 into serial formatted sections and use these as the contextual tokens for the chatbot.

## Impact

This is to help ICT teams to digest IM8 without the ability to cross-index the website, and to get help re-grouping policy by user topic, rather than IM8's sections e.g. info-inversion asking about what NOT than what IS: "what kind of security aspects only require agency acceptance and not waivers".

## Data Source

Publicly available IM8-reform
